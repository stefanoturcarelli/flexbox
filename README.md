# Flexbox

The four characteristics of Flexbox
1. Direction
2. Alignment
3. Ordering
4. Flexibility

To justify a `div` with two or more `<p></p>` inside, use `text-align: center;`, `justify-content: center;`, and `align-items: center;`.

`justify-content: space-between;`: Puts equal space between items. 

`justify-content: space-around;`: Puts the same space around the items.

`justify-content: space-evenly;`: Puts the same space on every gap.
